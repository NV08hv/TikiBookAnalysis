## Tiki Book Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the discount rate for books on the Tiki app. We use data from previous book purchase transactions to build a predictive model for discount rates. The goal is to help Tiki gain a better understanding of customer book-buying behavior and optimize discount strategies to increase revenue.
